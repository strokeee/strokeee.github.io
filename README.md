This here is my little learning project, a game if you will. It's stylized after old terminals, though those didn't have buttons. So this project is my first where I actually code, and intend to sporadically develop and build off of it. Eventually, when I earn enough knowlege I'll be trying to recreate this in C#, as an actual app. If anybody sees this, wish me luck lol.
